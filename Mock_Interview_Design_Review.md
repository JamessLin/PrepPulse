## ‚ùå What Could Be Improved

### 1. Call to Action Hierarchy (6.5/10)
- The "Cancel" and "Schedule Interview" buttons have almost equal weight.
- **Fix:** Make "Schedule Interview" primary with bolder visual weight. Dim or ghost the "Cancel" button.

### 2. Empty Space on Right (6/10)
- The right side of the screen feels imbalanced with too much empty space.
- **Fix:** Consider centering the scheduling card or showing a helpful preview/summary on the right.

### 3. Interview Type Details Are Too Minimal (7/10)
- Users may want more clarity on what each type involves.
- **Fix:** Add tooltips or a ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù link that expands/collapses.

### 4. Microcopy/UX Writing Opportunities
- ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be matched with a peer‚Ä¶‚Äù is helpful, but could be more action-oriented.
- **Fix:** Try, "You're all set! We‚Äôll match you with a peer who's also available at 3:00 PM."

### 5. No Visual Reinforcement of Peer Matching Concept
- The peer-matching mechanism is mentioned, but not visually reinforced.
- **Fix:** Consider a friendly illustration or icon showing two people being matched.

### 6. Accessibility Contrast (7/10)
- The purple text and light backgrounds could fail WCAG AA contrast in some cases.
- **Fix:** Slightly deepen purples for better contrast or add hover states that improve visibility.

## üß† Bonus UX Ideas to Boost Retention

- **Add a Confirmation Modal:** After clicking ‚ÄúSchedule Interview,‚Äù give a warm confirmation.
- **Include Calendar Integration:** Offer to add it to Google/Outlook right after confirmation.
- **Show Social Proof:** e.g., ‚Äú4,512 mock interviews successfully completed this week.‚Äù
- **Gamify Progress:** Let users track how many mock interviews they've completed and give badges.
